    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>
        I am a passionate and dedicated third-year engineering student at KSIT college, currently on track to graduate in 2026. 
        With a strong foundation in computer science and a keen interest in artificial intelligence, I have gained  proficiency 
        in programming languages like Python and Java, as well as in essential web development technologies such as HTML,  CSS, 
        Flask, and SQL. Over the course of my academic journey, I have developed a solid understanding of  Machine     Learning 
        algorithms, deep learning concepts, and frameworks like TensorFlow, enabling me to build and deploy intelligent systems 
        with real-world applications.

        In my third year, I worked on a minor project focused on <strong>skin cancer detection using AI</strong>. This project 
        utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze and classify skin lesion images, aiming to assist in early 
        detection through automation and accuracy. The experience not only strengthened my practical knowledge in deep learning 
        and image processing but also taught me how to integrate models into user-friendly interfaces. As I approach the final 
        year of my degree, Iâ€™m excited to take on more challenging projects, collaborate with professionals, and continue 
        exploring the cutting edge of AI and software development.
